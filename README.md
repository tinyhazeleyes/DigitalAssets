# DigitalAssets
WooCommerce plug-in to sell Stellar Lumens using your Binance account.

You need to install composer and the follow repositories in the DigitalAssets folder:

Connecting to Binance: Jaggedsoft/php-binance-api - https://github.com/jaggedsoft/php-binance-api

Encrypting and decrypting Binance info: Defuse php encryptions - https://github.com/defuse/php-encryption

The DigitalAssets folder needs to me added to the wp-content/plugins folder.

Enjoy!
